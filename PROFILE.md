## Builder Since 1979

I began my career in 1979 at Signetics Corp when microprocessors were still new. I moved from laser scribing to board-level repair and system builds, working across 8080 through Pentium II systems and operating environments from DOS 3.3 to Windows NT and XP.

I served as a Network Administrator and earned MCSE and Cisco CCNP certifications during the early enterprise networking era — before cloud, before virtualization, before everything became abstracted.

After stepping away to build a second career in carpentry, I never stopped building systems as a hobbyist. 

Now, with AI reshaping the industry, I’m back full time — studying, experimenting, and engineering AI systems. It feels like the early days again.

I’ve seen one revolution. I intend to be part of this one.
